# Project Overview

This study investigates the impact of succinate on aging-related oral dysbiosis and inflammation. Our results highlight the importance of succinate signaling through SUCNR1 in regulating inflammation, alveolar bone loss, and shifts in the oral microbiome, offering potential targets for therapeutic
interventions in aging-related oral health issues.

**Key Findings:**
- Increased succinate levels and alveolar bone loss in aged WT mice.
- Reduced bone loss and inflammation in aged SUCNR1 KO mice.
- Significant shifts in the oral microbiome associated with aging.

## Repository Organization
